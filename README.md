### Leptospirosis in Brazil

The data comes from DATASUS/SINAN, which is the official notification system of the Brazilian MoH, [here](https://datasus.saude.gov.br/informacoes-de-saude-tabnet/).

Here we're exploring notified cases by municipality of residence, from 2001 to 2017 (there is also data available until 2020, but those are currently flagged as "under review").
